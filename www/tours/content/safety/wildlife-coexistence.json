  "description": "The Arizona high desert is home to diverse wildlife, and following basic safety guidelines ensures positive experiences for both humans and animals. General principles: observe wildlife from a distance, never feed wild animals (it's harmful to them and dangerous for you), make noise while hiking to avoid surprising animals, stay on designated trails, keep pets leashed, and secure all food and trash. For snakes: watch where you step and place your hands, stay on trails, and if you encounter a snake, give it space and slowly back away. For large mammals (javelina, deer, mountain lions): maintain at least 50 yards distance, don't approach or corner animals, and if a mountain lion is spotted, face the animal, appear large, and slowly back away. For insects and arachnids: shake out shoes and clothing, check camping gear, and be cautious around rocks and logs where scorpions may hide.",
  "safety": "This entire entry is safety information. Key principle: Wildlife is not dangerous when respected and given space. Most incidents occur when humans get too close or attempt to interact with animals.",
  "fun_fact": "Most 'aggressive' wildlife encounters occur because animals feel cornered or are protecting young. Giving space and an escape route almost always prevents conflict."
