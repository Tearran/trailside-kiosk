  "description": "Theodore Roosevelt Dam was the first major project of the U.S. Reclamation Service (now Bureau of Reclamation), established in 1902 to develop water resources in the arid West. Construction began in 1903 in the remote Tonto Basin, requiring the building of the Apache Trail road to haul equipment and materials to the site. The original dam was constructed of massive cyclopean masonry—huge blocks of quarried stone fitted together with concrete mortar. When completed in 1911, it stood 280 feet high and was the world's tallest masonry dam. President Theodore Roosevelt himself dedicated the dam in 1911, calling it 'a monument to the men who built it.' The dam's primary purpose was to provide reliable water storage for the Salt River Valley, enabling the growth of Phoenix and surrounding agricultural areas. It also generated hydroelectric power. The original dam was raised by 77 feet between 1989-1996, bringing its height to 357 feet and increasing reservoir capacity by 20%. The dam was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1963, recognizing its engineering significance and its role in developing the American West. Today, the dam and reservoir continue to provide water storage, flood control, and recreation opportunities for millions of people.",
  "safety": "The dam area is an active facility. Follow all posted signs and barriers. Swimming and boating are prohibited immediately below the dam. Water releases can occur without warning.",
  "fun_fact": "During construction, workers lived in a temporary town called 'Roosevelt' with a population over 1,500. The entire town was disassembled when construction finished! About 1 million cubic yards of masonry were used in the dam's original construction—all transported by mule and wagon."
