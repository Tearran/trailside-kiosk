  "description": "The Salado people were a prehistoric culture that flourished in the Tonto Basin and surrounding areas from approximately 1150 to 1450 CE. The name 'Salado' (Spanish for 'salty') was given by archaeologists because their sites are often found along the Salt River and its tributaries. The Salado are best known for their distinctive polychrome pottery featuring black and white designs on red clay, and their cliff dwellings built in natural alcoves high on canyon walls. The most famous Salado sites near Roosevelt Lake are the Upper and Lower Cliff Dwellings at Tonto National Monument, remarkably preserved structures that offer glimpses into daily life 700 years ago. The Salado were successful desert farmers who built irrigation canals, grew corn, beans, and squash, and supplemented their diet with hunted game and gathered wild plants. They also engaged in extensive trade networks, exchanging goods across the Southwest. Around 1450 CE, the Salado culture underwent major changes—people abandoned the cliff dwellings and the distinctive pottery styles disappeared. The reasons for this transition remain debated, but likely involved a combination of drought, resource depletion, social changes, and migration. The Salado did not disappear—their descendants are likely among modern Puebloan peoples and other southwestern tribes.",
