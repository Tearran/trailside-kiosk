  "summary": "North America's only venomous lizard, covered in distinctive beaded scales.",
  "description": "The Gila monster is a remarkable reptile and one of only two venomous lizards in the world. These heavy-bodied lizards can reach up to 22 inches long and weigh 3-5 pounds, with striking patterns of black and orange, pink, or yellow beaded scales. Despite their fearsome reputation, Gila monsters are actually quite docile and rarely bite humans—most incidents occur when people attempt to handle them. They spend up to 95% of their lives underground in burrows, emerging primarily during spring to feed and mate. Gila monsters are opportunistic feeders, consuming bird and reptile eggs, young birds and mammals, and carrion. They can eat up to one-third of their body weight in a single meal and store fat in their tails for lean times. Their venom, delivered through grooved teeth when they chew, is used primarily for defense rather than hunting. Interestingly, a protein found in Gila monster venom has been developed into a medication for type 2 diabetes.",
  "safety": "Gila monsters are protected by law. Never attempt to touch or handle one. They move slowly and give plenty of warning. If you see one, admire it from a safe distance and allow it to move on. Bites are extremely rare and usually occur only when the animal is provoked or handled.",
  "fun_fact": "Gila monsters can detect prey buried underground using their forked tongues to 'taste' scent molecules in the air. They're also one of the few venomous animals that are immune to their own venom!"
