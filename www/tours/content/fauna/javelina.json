  "summary": "Pig-like mammals that travel in family groups, foraging for desert plants.",
  "description": "Despite their appearance, javelinas (also called collared peccaries) are not pigs—they're actually more closely related to hippos. These stout animals typically weigh 40-60 pounds and have coarse, grizzled gray hair with a distinctive lighter-colored 'collar' around their shoulders. Javelinas are highly social, living in herds of 6-12 individuals that forage together. They're primarily herbivorous, using their tough snouts to root out prickly pear cactus (their favorite food), agave, mesquite beans, and various desert plants. Their poor eyesight is compensated by excellent senses of smell and hearing. Javelinas have scent glands that produce a musky odor used for communication and group recognition. They're most active during cooler hours—morning, evening, and night—and rest in the shade during hot afternoons. While they appear docile, javelinas will defend themselves and their young if threatened, using their sharp canine teeth.",
  "safety": "Give javelinas space, especially if young are present. Never feed them—they can become aggressive when food-conditioned. If approached, make noise and back away slowly. Javelinas have poor eyesight and may approach out of curiosity, not aggression.",
  "fun_fact": "Javelinas can crunch through prickly pear cactus spines with ease, thanks to their tough mouths and strong jaws. A group of javelinas is called a 'squadron' or 'troop.'"
