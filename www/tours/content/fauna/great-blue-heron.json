  "summary": "Majestic wading bird standing over 4 feet tall, often seen hunting along the lakeshore.",
  "description": "The great blue heron is North America's largest heron, standing up to 4.5 feet tall with a wingspan reaching 6 feet. These elegant birds have slate-blue plumage, a white head with black plumes, and long yellowish bills perfect for spearing fish. Great blue herons are patient hunters, often standing motionless in shallow water for extended periods before striking with lightning speed to catch fish, frogs, small mammals, or even small birds. They're commonly seen along Roosevelt Lake's shores and in nearby wetlands. These birds are typically solitary hunters but nest in colonies called 'rookeries,' often high in trees. Their flight is distinctive—slow, powerful wingbeats with their neck folded into an S-shape and legs trailing behind. Great blue herons are highly adaptable, hunting in fresh and saltwater environments, and can be found year-round in Arizona, though some individuals migrate from northern regions to spend winters here.",
  "safety": "Great blue herons are not dangerous to humans but should be observed from a respectful distance. Approaching nesting colonies can cause stress and nest abandonment. Use binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens for close-up views.",
  "fun_fact": "Despite their large size, great blue herons weigh only 5-6 pounds thanks to hollow bones. They can also hunt at night using specialized night vision, and have been known to use tools—dropping insects on the water surface to attract fish!"
