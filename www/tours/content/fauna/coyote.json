  "summary": "Highly adaptable canine whose haunting howls echo across the desert at dusk.",
  "description": "The coyote is one of North America's most successful predators, thriving even as human development expands. These intelligent canines typically weigh 20-50 pounds and have grayish-brown fur that helps them blend into the desert landscape. Coyotes are omnivores with diverse diets including small mammals, birds, insects, fruits, and even carrion. They hunt primarily at dawn and dusk, using their keen hearing to locate prey. Coyotes are highly social animals that communicate through barks, yips, and their famous howls—which serve to define territory and coordinate pack activities. A mated pair often stays together for many years, raising 5-7 pups each spring in dens dug into hillsides or under rock outcroppings. Their adaptability to varied habitats and food sources has allowed them to expand their range across North America over the past century.",
  "safety": "Coyotes are generally wary of humans. Never feed coyotes—it creates dangerous habituation. Keep pets leashed and close, especially at dawn and dusk. If you encounter a coyote, make yourself appear large, make noise, and maintain eye contact while backing away slowly.",
  "fun_fact": "Coyotes can run up to 40 mph and leap up to 13 feet, making them excellent hunters. Their scientific name 'latrans' means 'barking dog' in Latin."
