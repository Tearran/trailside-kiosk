  "summary": "America's national symbol nests year-round at Roosevelt Lake.",
  "description": "Roosevelt Lake is home to a mating pair of bald eagles that nest here year-round—a testament to the successful recovery of this once-endangered species. Adult bald eagles are unmistakable with their white heads and tails, dark brown bodies, and impressive 6-8 foot wingspans. These powerful raptors primarily feed on fish, which they catch by swooping down and snatching from the water's surface with their sharp talons, but they also opportunistically hunt waterfowl and scavenge carrion. Bald eagles build massive nests called 'aeries' in tall trees near water—some nests are used for decades and can weigh over a ton. They mate for life and return to the same nesting territory each year. Young eagles don't develop the iconic white head and tail until they're 4-5 years old. Bald eagles were nearly driven to extinction in the lower 48 states by the 1960s due to DDT pesticide poisoning, habitat loss, and hunting. Thanks to protection under the Endangered Species Act and the banning of DDT, populations have recovered remarkably—a true conservation success story.",
  "safety": "Observe eagles from a distance with binoculars or a spotting scope. Never approach nesting sites, as disturbance can cause nest abandonment. Eagles are protected by federal law—harassing or harming them carries severe penalties.",
  "fun_fact": "Bald eagles aren't actually bald—their name comes from an old English word 'balde' meaning white. They can dive at speeds up to 100 mph when hunting, and their grip strength is about 10 times stronger than a human's!"
