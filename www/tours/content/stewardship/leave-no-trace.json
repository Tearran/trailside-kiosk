  "summary": "Seven principles for minimizing human impact on natural areas. Help preserve trails for future generations.",
  "description": "The Leave No Trace principles provide a framework for outdoor ethics: 1) Plan Ahead and Prepare - know regulations, be ready for weather and hazards. 2) Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces - stick to established trails, camp in designated areas. 3) Dispose of Waste Properly - pack out all trash, use facilities when available, or bury human waste 6-8 inches deep at least 200 feet from water. 4) Leave What You Find - don't take rocks, plants, or artifacts; don't build structures. 5) Minimize Campfire Impacts - use established fire rings or portable stoves. 6) Respect Wildlife - observe from distance, never feed animals, secure food properly. 7) Be Considerate of Others - yield trail when appropriate, keep noise down, take breaks away from the trail. These principles ensure that the beauty and ecological health of areas like Roosevelt Lake remain intact for future visitors and for the wildlife that calls this home.",
  "safety": "Following Leave No Trace principles also enhances safety - proper planning prevents emergencies, staying on trails avoids dangerous terrain, and proper waste disposal prevents wildlife conflicts.",
  "fun_fact": "The Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics was founded in 1994, but indigenous peoples have practiced similar principles for thousands of years, living sustainably with the land."
