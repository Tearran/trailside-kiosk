  "description": "Mesquite trees are desert survivors par excellence, with taproot systems that can extend over 100 feet deep to reach underground water sources—some of the deepest roots of any North American tree. These hardy trees grow 20-30 feet tall with spreading, irregular canopies that provide welcome shade. Mesquite trees are legumes that produce long seed pods (4-8 inches) containing sweet, nutritious seeds surrounded by edible pulp. These pods have been a crucial food source for indigenous peoples for thousands of years, ground into flour for bread and cakes. Wildlife including deer, javelina, birds, and rodents also rely heavily on mesquite pods. The wood burns hot and slow with a distinctive aroma, making it prized for cooking and heating. Mesquite trees host nitrogen-fixing bacteria in their root nodules, actually enriching the soil around them. They're also important 'nurse plants'—their canopy creates microclimates where other desert plants can establish. The tiny yellow flowers appear in spring, providing nectar for bees that produce highly valued mesquite honey.",
  "safety": "Mesquite trees have thorns that can be quite sharp. Watch for low branches when walking near them, and be cautious when collecting fallen pods from the ground.",
  "fun_fact": "A mesquite tree can live 200+ years, and mesquite wood is so dense it doesn't float! Native peoples made mesquite pod flour that could be stored for years without spoiling."
