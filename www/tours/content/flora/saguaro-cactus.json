  "summary": "Iconic symbol of the American West, can live over 200 years and grow 40 feet tall.",
  "description": "The saguaro is perhaps the most recognizable symbol of the American desert, though they grow naturally only in the Sonoran Desert. These massive cacti can grow to 40-60 feet tall and weigh over 8 tons when fully hydrated. Saguaros are incredibly slow-growing—a 10-year-old saguaro might be only 2 inches tall, and their iconic arms don't typically appear until the plant is 50-70 years old. The pleated structure of their trunk allows them to expand and contract like an accordion, storing up to 200 gallons of water during rare desert rains. In late spring, saguaros produce stunning white flowers that bloom at night and are pollinated by bats, birds, and insects. These flowers develop into red fruits that ripen in summer, providing crucial food for desert wildlife. Saguaros create vital habitat—their holes and crevices house countless bird species, including Gila woodpeckers who excavate nest cavities that are later used by elf owls, flycatchers, and other birds.",
  "safety": "Saguaros are protected by Arizona state law. Harming or removing them is illegal and carries significant fines. Their ribs and spines are sharp—admire from a safe distance.",
  "fun_fact": "A saguaro doesn't grow its first arm until it's 75-100 years old! The tallest saguaro ever recorded was 78 feet tall. Saguaro flowers are Arizona's state flower."
