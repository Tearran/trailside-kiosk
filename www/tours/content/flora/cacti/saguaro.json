  "category": "flora/cacti",
  "summary": "Iconic symbol of the American Southwest. Can live over 200 years and grow up to 40 feet tall.",
  "description": "The saguaro is perhaps the most recognizable symbol of the desert Southwest. These massive cacti grow very slowly - a 10-year-old saguaro is typically only 1.5 inches tall. They don't grow their first arm until they're 75-100 years old. Saguaros provide crucial habitat for desert wildlife, with their flowers, fruits, and hollow trunks serving as food and shelter for numerous species including Gila woodpeckers, elf owls, and bats.",
  "safety": "Federal law protects saguaros. Damaging or removing them is illegal. Stay on trails to avoid stepping on young cacti. The spines are sharp and can cause painful injuries.",
  "fun_fact": "A fully hydrated saguaro can weigh as much as an elephant (up to 4,800 pounds), with its pleated structure expanding accordion-style to store water."
