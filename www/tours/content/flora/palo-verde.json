  "description": "The palo verde (Spanish for 'green stick') is a remarkable desert tree named for its distinctive green bark and branches. This green color isn't just for show—the bark contains chlorophyll and performs photosynthesis, allowing the tree to produce energy even when it has shed its tiny leaves to conserve water during droughts. Palo verde trees can reach 25 feet tall with a spreading canopy that provides crucial shade in the desert. In spring, these trees explode with brilliant yellow flowers that blanket the entire canopy, creating a stunning golden display visible for miles. The flowers attract bees, butterflies, and other pollinators. Palo verde trees are legumes, producing bean-like seed pods that wildlife and historically humans have used as food. Their extensive root systems help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. These trees are remarkably drought-tolerant and can survive by tapping into deep groundwater sources. The shade beneath palo verde trees creates vital 'nurse plant' habitat where young saguaros and other desert plants can establish themselves, protected from intense sun.",
  "safety": "Palo verde trees have small thorns on their branches. Be cautious when seeking shade beneath them, and watch for thorny branches at eye level.",
  "fun_fact": "Palo verde trees can photosynthesize through their bark when leafless, producing up to 70% of the tree's food! The blue palo verde was designated Arizona's state tree in 1954."
