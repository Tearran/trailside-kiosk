  "summary": "Ancient desert survivor with a distinctive rain-scent, some colonies are over 11,000 years old.",
  "description": "The creosote bush is one of North America's most successful desert plants, dominating vast areas of the Sonoran, Mojave, and Chihuahuan deserts. These evergreen shrubs typically grow 3-10 feet tall with small, resinous leaves that have a distinctive, pleasant smell especially strong after rain—a scent that defines the desert Southwest for many people. The leaves are coated with a waxy resin that helps prevent water loss and protects against UV radiation. Creosote bushes are remarkable survivors—they can lose their leaves during extreme drought and regrow them when water returns. Individual bushes can live 100-200 years, but creosote reproduces by cloning itself outward in a ring pattern. The famous 'King Clone' in California's Mojave Desert is estimated to be 11,700 years old, making it one of Earth's oldest living organisms. Small yellow flowers bloom year-round when moisture is available, producing fuzzy white seed balls. The plant produces allelopathic chemicals that inhibit growth of nearby plants, which is why you often see creosote bushes evenly spaced across the desert—a phenomenon called 'allelopathic spacing.' Despite this, many animals and insects make homes in creosote, and its resin has been used medicinally for generations.",
  "safety": "Creosote is non-toxic but the resin can cause skin irritation in sensitive individuals. Some people are allergic to the pollen produced by its flowers.",
  "fun_fact": "The distinctive smell of creosote after desert rain comes from over 60 different chemical compounds in the plant's resin. Native peoples used creosote for treating numerous ailments, and it's still studied for potential medicinal properties."
