  "category": "fungi/lichens",
  "summary": "Symbiotic organism formed by algae and fungi living together. Grows on desert rocks and boulders.",
  "description": "Lichens are remarkable organisms that represent a symbiotic relationship between fungi and algae (or cyanobacteria). The fungus provides structure and protection, while the algae produces food through photosynthesis. Rock shield lichens grow extremely slowly - some patches may be hundreds of years old. They are excellent indicators of air quality, as they are sensitive to pollution. In the desert, they help break down rock surfaces, beginning the soil formation process.",
  "safety": "Do not remove or damage lichens. They grow very slowly and are important for ecosystem health.",
  "fun_fact": "Lichens can survive in extreme environments including Antarctica and even the vacuum of space, making them one of Earth's hardiest life forms."
