  "description": "Puffball mushrooms are named for their unique spore dispersal method—when mature, the slightest touch or raindrop impact causes them to release a cloud of spores that looks like a puff of smoke. These round, ball-shaped fungi typically appear after summer monsoon rains in the desert, growing on organic matter in soil. Young puffballs are white and firm with edible flesh, while mature puffballs develop a papery outer skin and fill with powdery spores that can number in the trillions. Some desert puffballs are small (1-2 inches), while others can grow to softball size or larger. The spore clouds can travel great distances on the wind, helping puffballs colonize new areas. When young and white throughout (no gills or internal structure), many puffball species are edible and have been used as food, though proper identification is crucial as some toxic mushrooms can look similar when young. Puffballs play an important ecological role in breaking down organic matter and recycling nutrients in desert soils.",
  "safety": "Never eat wild mushrooms unless you are absolutely certain of identification. Some toxic species can resemble young puffballs. Always cut a puffball in half—if it's pure white throughout with no gills or stems, it may be edible, but consult an expert first.",
  "fun_fact": "A single large puffball can produce over 7 trillion spores! Native peoples used dried puffballs as wound dressings—the spores have antimicrobial properties. Puffballs were also used historically as tinder for starting fires."
