  "description": "Desert truffles are fascinating underground fungi that have been harvested by indigenous peoples of the Southwest for thousands of years. Unlike their expensive European cousins, desert truffles are more common but equally delicious. These fungi grow 2-4 inches underground in mycorrhizal partnerships with shrubs like saltbush and other desert plants—the truffle helps the plant absorb water and nutrients while the plant provides the truffle with sugars from photosynthesis. Desert truffles appear after winter and early spring rains, typically from February through April. Experienced foragers look for small cracks in the soil near host plants where truffles are pushing upward. The truffles have a firm, potato-like texture and earthy, nutty flavor. They vary in color from white to brown to reddish. Desert truffles were so important to some indigenous groups that they tracked rainfall patterns and traveled to known truffle grounds for harvests. Today, sustainable harvesting continues in some areas, though over-collection is a concern.",
  "safety": "Only harvest desert truffles if you are certain of identification and have permission to forage in the area. Some desert fungi can be toxic. Learn from an experienced forager before attempting to collect wild fungi.",
  "fun_fact": "Desert truffles were so valued by indigenous peoples that some groups established complex trading networks around them. Unlike European truffles that can cost thousands per pound, desert truffles are much more affordable but still delicious!"
